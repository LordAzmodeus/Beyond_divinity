0,13,0,0,3,"Nixfix, uncle of Taxlehix, turns out to be rather senile and forgetful. He told me about a monster living somewhere down here in the tunnels. I should be very cautious."
0,13,0,0,4,"I found the monster Nixfix was talking about and I killed it. Maybe the old imp will be happy to hear that."
0,13,0,0,5,"I might have known! Nixfix forgot about me, the monster and the fact that the monster is dead, so I don't think there's much sense in insisting on a reward. But, he also told me about a key to his chest. If I find it, I'm sure he will have forgotten that he'd even lost it in the first place!"
