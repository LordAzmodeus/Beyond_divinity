0,65,1,0,5,"High Elder Anlokar... the head of the Academy... he spoke in your favour..."
0,65,1,0,11,"Courage, outlander... seek courage... the High Elder will be very disappointed..."
0,65,1,0,12,"Still busy with your tests, Damian?... Come back after your final evaluation... when the fourth room opens..."

0,65,2,0,6,"Brave outlander! But... are you worthy?"
0,65,2,0,7,"Blah-blah-blah... talk-talk-talk... let's have some action!"
0,65,2,0,8,"Not so fast! Three tests to pass... Test of Knowledge... Test of Endurance... Test of Faith. They will show if you are worthy..."
0,65,2,0,9,"Go through the open doors... talk to the instructor... three times..."
0,65,2,0,10,"Before you go... read the Code of Behaviour on the wall... 16 rules... what is allowed... what is forbidden..."
0,65,2,0,11,"Damn ghosts, never stop chattering!."
0,65,2,0,12,"Then a fourth door opens... and you will receive your final evaluation."
0,65,2,0,36,"Who are you...? Come a little closer... Can't quite see you... Aaaaahhh... You... Finally! I was expecting you earlier..."
0,65,2,0,37,"You were expecting me?"
0,65,2,0,38,"The High Elder told us, Damian..."
0,65,2,0,39,"The initial tests for the Academy are an honour... especially for an outlander... Are you ready, Damian?"
0,65,2,0,40,"Don't look at me... I'm as puzzled as you are... I believe, he thinks you're Damian. The Child of Chaos studied at the Academy after he arrived here, and before he decided to conquer this place..."
0,65,2,0,41,"I would suggest you play along, human. We have to learn a way to escape from here, and if they think you are *allowed* to do it, we would be foolish not to use it to our advantage."
0,65,2,0,42,"What are the initial tests?"
0,65,2,0,43,"Three rooms... three tests... are you worthy?..Are you ready Damian? Our expectations are high..."
