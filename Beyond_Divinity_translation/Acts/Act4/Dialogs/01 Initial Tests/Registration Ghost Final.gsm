0,237,2,0,23,"You've failed, Damian? How can this be..?"
0,237,2,0,24,"Can you give me a second chance?"
0,237,2,0,25,"Never a second chance... but... something is wrong... I don't understand..."
0,237,2,0,27,"The door to the next level is blocked... I called for the imps... they haven't show up... they're hiding in the maintenance tunnels..."
0,237,2,0,28,"Maintenance tunnels? Imps? Hmmm, maybe it is not so bad you failed the test after all... "
0,237,2,0,29,"Leave the Academy, Damain... you've failed... you are not allowed to go up... still it feels so wrong..."
0,237,2,0,30,"You've passed the tests? So there is promise within you..."
0,237,2,0,31,"The main door... leads to the next level... but it's blocked... "
0,237,2,0,32,"The imps have to fix it... they haven't shown up... I believe they're hiding in the maintenance tunnels..."
0,237,2,0,33,"Maintenance tunnels? Imps? Hmmm, maybe we don't have to wait. We know the imps won't show up if they've run from this spook house. "
0,237,2,0,34,"But if there are maintenance tunnels, we might be able to find our our way to the next level... but first we must find the entrance, human."
0,237,2,0,35,"If there are imps and maintenance tunnels, there might be another way to the next level... we only have to find the entrance to these tunnels, human."
0,237,2,0,44,"We don't need your permission, ghost! We'll find our way to the next level ourselves..."
